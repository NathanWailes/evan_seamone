## Summary of the steps I took:
1. Downloaded the case files
1. Renamed the case files to be their citation numbers.
1. Used UTFCast to convert all of them to UTF-8 format.
   - Two had some unknown encoding that couldn't be converted to UTF-8 and couldn't be read by Notepad, so those cases 
  were discarded / ignored going forward.
1. Separated the cases that only had a "Remand" section from the cases that had an "Order" section that it'd be quicker
to run regexes against the former.
